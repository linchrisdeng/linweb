        <b>An Empirical Study of Bid Prediction and Pricing Strategy in North American HVAC Market</b>
        <br/>
        <i>sponsored by <a href="https://www.daikinapplied.com/about.php">Daikin Applied Americas</a></i><br/>
        <b>Lin Deng</b>, Adhithya Shanmugam, and Hyoseok Suh<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>Designed a pricing strategy based on historical bid data and the bidding process. Predicting the bid outcome in North American HVAC market by using a ensemble Machine Learn- ing method which was inspired by <i><a href="https://quinonero.net/Publications/predicting-clicks-facebook.pdf" target="_blank">Facebook Ads Clicking Prediction Method</a></i>. Achieved prediction accuracy: 81%, recall (true positive rate): 82%</li>
          <li>Set up a Back-tested the pricing strategy base on Daikin bid data for both strategy design and bid price adjustment. Provided an efficient solution to clean and process bidding & component data and deploy it to models. Obtained a strategy of average profit of about 9% annual return over past 10+ years’ bid log</li>

        <b>Modeling Survivability of Breast Cancer</b><br/>
        <i>data sponsored by University of Minnesota Public Health Dept</i><br/>
        Lin Deng<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>A comprehensive breast cancer cell survivability models enable identifying and targeting women at high-risk, while reducing too-early interventions in those at low-risk</li>
          <li>Applied ML-based estimates models include clustering, boosting, tree-methods to find out relevant variables that can improve discriminatory accuracy</li>
          <li>Results are used to recommend screening guidelines for potential patients and the design of future treatment assessment models</li>

        <b>Handling Imbalanced Data – American Census Income Data</b><br/>
        Lin Deng<br/>
        <ul>
          <li>Collected statistics on the income – American Census data. Used the SMOTEBoost and RUSBoost to classify the imbalanced income data</li>
          <li>Use the N ̈aıveBayes classifier to build the model and use cross-validation to select the number of features to include. And use Bayesian networks to find the internal relationships between features and labels

        <ul>
          <li>Designed to model the relationship between sales price and seat allocation in subgroups within the alliance (e.g., codeshare flights) to increase expected profits.</li>
          <li>stimated seat load factor measurement error by days before departure base on past 5-year flight data and stochastic demand simulation.</li>
